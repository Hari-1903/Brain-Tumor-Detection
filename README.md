# Brain-Tumor-Detection
This project aims to develop a system that automatically detects brain tumors in MRI images using a deep learning model called U-Net. U-Net is a type of convolutional neural network (CNN) designed for semantic segmentation, which means it can classify each pixel in an image into different categories
